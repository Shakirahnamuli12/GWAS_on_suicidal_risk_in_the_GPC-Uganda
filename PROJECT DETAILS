# Background


Suicide has been defined as a fatal self-injurious act with some evidence of intent to die(Turecki & Brent, 2016). Suicide is huge worldwide health issue and a widespread cause of death among the young people (Bilsen, 2018; Hughes et al., 2023; Wasserman et al., 2005).
Sometimes suicide is not acknowledged or reported, because its sensitive nature and the taboo that is associated with  it(De Leo, 2015). Nearly 90% of people who commit suicide have suffered from at least one mental disorder(Gould, 2001). 
It has been observed that more men than women die by suicide (Bilsen, 2018).Uganda suicide rate for 2019 was 4.60%.7.6 males; 1.7 females per 100k population (World Population Review, 2000-2023). 
Suicide is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with various factors at play, including biological, psychological, and environmental elements(Lengvenyte et al., 2021; Mukherjee & Kumar, 2017; Orsolini et al., 2020; POLAT & CANSIZ, 2024).  Suicidal behavior demonstrates a significant genetic influence (Brent et al., 1996; Mirkovic et al., 2016). 
Genetics account for 43% of the explanation for suicidal behavior, while the remaining 57% is attributed to environmental factors (Crisafulli et al., 2010).Patients with major depressive disorder have a 20 times greater likelihood of committing suicide compared to the general population (Borentain et al., 2020).
One person every 40s die by suicide worldwide (Liu et al., 2022). Certain traits such as impulsivity and aggression are commonly cited risk factors (Van Heeringen, 2012). Research on the heritability of suicidal behavior has demonstrated a significant genetic influence(Mirkovic et al., 2016). 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have propelled genetic advancements in psychiatry.  Approximately 90% of individuals who exhibit suicidal tendencies have an associated mental or psychiatric condition, like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder (Isomets√§, 2014). 
Patients with major depressive disorder have a 20 times greater likelihood of committing suicide compared to the general population (Borentain et al., 2020). One person every 40s die by suicide worldwide (Liu et al., 2022). 
Studying suicidal traits both within and outside of mental disorders is essential to understand the characteristics of risk factors and to forecast and avert instances of suicide (DiBlasi et al., 2021). Grasping the intricacies of suicidal behavior is fundamental to its treatment and prevention. 
Considering the myriad factors contributing to suicide, such as neuroinflammation, activated inflammatory pathways, changes in certain brain areas, shifts in epigenetic regulation, malnutrition, past traumas, societal perceptions, psychological elements, and overall mental susceptibility, it becomes evident that the approach should lean towards precision medicine and tailored treatments rather than a universal drug solution (Abou Chahla et al., 2023).
The limited ancestral diversity in psychiatric genetics research up to now restricts the recognition and applicability of potential genetic risk elements, potentially leading to health inequalities (Kang & Ruderfer, 2020). Therefore more research into the understanding the genetic basis of suicidal behavior is urgently needed. 
A significant portion of individuals within the Uganda Genome Resource exhibits common mental disorders(Kalungi et al., 2023).
In  particular, an interesting hypothesis  supports the  genetic  basis  of  suicidal  behaviour,  plausibly independent  of  specific  genetic  factors  involved  insusceptibility to psychiatric disorders. These hypotheses were  initially  investigated  by  family,  twins,  and adoption studies.(Crisafulli et al., 2010). Suicide is a complicated, multimodal phenomenon involving several factors that include neurobiological, genetic, and psychosocial risk factors(Pandey, 2013).
This study aims to investigate the genetic basis of suicidal risk within the GPC (Global Psychiatric Cohort) by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with suicidal risk, refining association signals, and validating these findings through replication.
